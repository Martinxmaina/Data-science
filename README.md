# Data-science

This repository contains materials for various data science lessons. It's designed to be a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing data science techniques. Because no specific code was provided, this README will outline a general structure and best practices for a data science repository. You will need to populate the specifics based on your actual project files.

## Features and Functionality

This repository includes the following features:

* (e.g., Introduction to Pandas, including data manipulation and cleaning examples.). This will use Pandas and potentially NumPy.*
* Specific Lesson 2]:** *(e.g., Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Matplotlib and Seaborn, showcasing data visualization techniques)*
* Machine Learning Model Training with Scikit-learn, focusing on model selection, training, and evaluation*

## Technology Stack

* **Programming Languages:** Python (Specify versions if applicable, e.g., Python 3.9)
* **Libraries:**
    * Pandas
    * NumPy
    * Scikit-learn
    * Matplotlib
    * Seaborn
    * Plotly
